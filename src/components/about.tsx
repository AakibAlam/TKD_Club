        Among the large variety of sports facilities offered at IIT Kanpur, also
        lies the opportunity to learn the historic defense art form of
        Taekwondo. Taekwondo isn't just about physical strength but also about
        concentration and self-control. In IIT Kanpur, Taekwondo is organised by
        Taekwondo Club, commonly known as TKD club. Students learn Taekwondo
        under the guidance of the instructor Balram Yadav (Dan 5 Black Belt). A
        lot of importance is given to discipline and focus. It is not just an
        exercise, but development of a complete personality. It teaches a lot
        about building self-control and respect, not just for friends but also
        for opponents. Taekwondo performance is a mixture of steadiness and
        swiftness. It takes place at Taekwondo Arena, main stadium, near
        volleyball court. Our main focus is to provide a best physical fitness,
        competitive atmosphere to absorbed as a sport and self-defence specific
