          Among the large variety of sports facilities offered at IIT Kanpur,
          also lies the opportunity to learn the historic defense art form of
          Taekwondo. Taekwondo isn't just about physical strength but also about
          concentration and self-control. In IIT Kanpur, Taekwondo is organised
          by Taekwondo Club, commonly known as TKD club. Students learn
          Taekwondo under the guidance of the instructor Balram Yadav (Dan 5
          Black Belt). A lot of importance is given to discipline and focus. It
          is not just an exercise, but development of a complete personality. It
          teaches a lot about building self-control and respect, not just for
          friends but also for opponents. Taekwondo performance is a mixture of
          steadiness and swiftness. It takes place at Taekwondo Arena, main
          stadium, near volleyball court. Our main focus is to provide a best
          physical fitness, competitive atmosphere to absorbed as a sport and
          self-defence specific skill which may come handy at the time of
          trouble.
